We are glad to inform you that more members have worked at the EUCENTRAL team in the past months.

Jack Dunham joined in February as a support team technical specialist, focusing on software development, data management, and creation of code and software documentation. 

Dawid Hryniuk joined in June as an assistant researcher, focusing on the development of quantum Monte Carlo and tensor network methods, as well as on adjustment of our codes for broader use, and tutorial preparation.

Thank you both for your contributions!
